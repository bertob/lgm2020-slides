Slides for my (remote) LGM talk about icons at GNOME

### Abstract

Over the past few years the way we do icons at GNOME has changed significantly: We have an overhauled style for app icons, a new approach to symbolic icons in apps, and a number of neat new little helper apps, all in the service of one thing: Making icons dramatically easier for third party app developers and designers.

To enable these easier workflows we've come up with a number of unorthodox solutions that challenge some of the classic best practices of icon design, such as multiple icon sizes, pixel hinting, and the icon name spec.

I'll talk about how this initiative came to be, where we are right now (with some live demos), and what's in store for the future.
